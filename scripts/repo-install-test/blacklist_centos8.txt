# These packages will not get explicitly installed in this test.
# Package lines must have nothing but the package (no comment,
# no additional space etc).

# The ulfius package in network:osmocom:* is linked to the opensuse version,
# which has dependencies that exist under another name in centos
# (libgnutls-devel, libjansson-devel). Linking to the opensuse version has the
# advantage that we don't need to worry about updating the package. However,
# the dependency problem means that we can't simply install the package in
# centos. In OBS we work around this in the project config.
ulfius-devel
