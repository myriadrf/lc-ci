The scripts in this directory are used to create an archive of Osmocom related
packages from OBS, at: https://downloads.osmocom.org/obs-mirror/

There is no mechanism in place to deploy updated scripts after updating them
here in osmo-ci.git, so this must be done manually.

See OS#4862 for more information.
